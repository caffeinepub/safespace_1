  "summary": "Most SafeSpace UI/UX requirements appear implemented: aurora CSS background, glassmorphism login card with terms-gated II login + guest button, decorative corner accent, BrandLogo assets usage, and a redesigned sticky white authenticated header with logout clearing React Query. One key gap is that the header navigation is not fully non-navigating due to mobile menu buttons wiring into page navigation.",

      "reason": "While the desktop header nav buttons appear to be non-functional (no onClick shown), the mobile Sheet menu wires buttons to `handleNavClick`, which calls `onNavigate(page)` and would change the current page/content when tapped.",
