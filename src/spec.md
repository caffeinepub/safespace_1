## Summary
**Goal:** Apply a light pink and purple color scheme with crisp white backgrounds across the entire SafeSpace application.

**Planned changes:**
- Update global background color to crisp white throughout the application
- Apply light pink as the primary accent color for buttons, cards, borders, highlights, and interactive elements
- Add purple as a secondary accent color to complement light pink and create visual hierarchy
- Update Tailwind theme configuration in tailwind.config.js with light pink and purple color variables
- Update index.css theme variables to reflect the new color scheme
- Replace all existing color references in components with new theme tokens

**User-visible outcome:** The entire application displays a cohesive light pink and purple color scheme with white backgrounds, creating a visually appealing and consistent user experience across all pages and components.
